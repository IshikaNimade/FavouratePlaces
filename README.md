# React Native Firebase Places App

This is a React Native application that uses Firebase as the backend, Axios for API calls, and Firebase Auth for login and signup. 

The app allows users to view a list of favorite places with their locations, add new places, and mark them on Google Maps. User data is securely stored using SQLite on the device.
